ARTHUR:  You fight with the strength of many men, Sir knight.
      I am Arthur, King of the Britons.
      [pause]
      I seek the finest and the bravest knights in the land to join me
      in my Court of Camelot.
      [pause]
      You have proved yourself worthy; will you join me?
      [pause]
      You make me sad.  So be it.  Come, Patsy.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  None shall pass.
  ARTHUR:  I have no quarrel with you, good Sir knight, but I must
      cross this bridge.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Then you shall die.
  ARTHUR:  I command you as King of the Britons to stand aside!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  I move for no man.
  ARTHUR:  So be it!
      [hah]
      [parry thrust]
      [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's left arm off]
  ARTHUR:  Now stand aside, worthy adversary.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  'Tis but a scratch.
  ARTHUR:  A scratch?  Your arm's off!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  No, it isn't.
  ARTHUR:  Well, what's that then?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  I've had worse.
  ARTHUR:  You liar!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on you pansy!
      [hah]
      [parry thrust]
      [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's right arm off]
  ARTHUR:  Victory is mine!
      [kneeling]
      We thank thee Lord, that in thy merc-
      [hah]
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Come on then.
  ARTHUR:  What?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Have at you!
  ARTHUR:  You are indeed brave, Sir knight, but the fight is mine.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, had enough, eh?
  ARTHUR:  Look, you stupid bastard, you've got no arms left.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Yes I have.
  ARTHUR:  Look!
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Just a flesh wound.
      [bang]
  ARTHUR:  Look, stop that.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Chicken!  Chicken!
  ARTHUR:  Look, I'll have your leg.  Right!
      [whop]
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Right, I'll do you for that!
  ARTHUR:  You'll what?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Come 'ere!
  ARTHUR:  What are you going to do, bleed on me?
  BLACK KNIGHT:  I'm invincible!
  ARTHUR:  You're a loony.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  The Black Knight always triumphs!
      Have at you!  Come on then.
      [whop]
      [ARTHUR chops the BLACK KNIGHT's other leg off]
  BLACK KNIGHT:  All right; we'll call it a draw.
  ARTHUR:  Come, Patsy.
  BLACK KNIGHT:  Oh, oh, I see, running away then.  You yellow
      bastards!  Come back here and take what's coming to you.
      I'll bite your legs off!
